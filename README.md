Roc2End is a toy End2End framework.

### WebDriver Client

The [WebDriver.roc](./src//WebDriver.roc) module is a thin http client wrapper for webdriver, and I try to stick to the [W3C Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver2/).

It might be a good idea to extract this to a separate package if it grows.

Might be useful for web crawling, generating PDFs from html, and so on...
